# Embedding Analysis – TensorFlow Visualization & Insights

## Step 1: Introduction to Embeddings and RAG


Embeddings are **numerical representations of text** that capture meaning in a way that machines can understand. Each word, sentence, or document can be converted into a vector (a list of numbers), where the position of each value reflects some aspect of the text’s semantic meaning.

In RAG systems, embeddings are used to find **the most relevant pieces of information** from a database or document set before passing them to a large language model (LLM). This is really useful when the LLM doesn’t know something off-hand and needs to "look it up."

Instead of just matching keywords (like a regular search engine), RAG systems use **vector similarity** — most commonly via **dot product** or **cosine similarity** — to compare the semantic closeness between a user’s question and available documents.

## Step 2: Visualizing Embeddings (TensorFlow Projector)

To explore the idea of embeddings visually, We used the [TensorFlow Embedding Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/). We uploaded a small dataset of 6 documents (provided in the exercise) along with their 3D vector representations.

###  What I Did:

- Created a **metadata TSV file** with the document texts.
- Created a **vectors TSV file** with the 3-dimensional vectors.
- Uploaded both files to the TensorFlow Projector.
- Enabled PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce and visualize the dimensions.

###  Observations & Insights:

Here are some interesting things I noticed:

1. **Semantic Clusters Formed Naturally**:
   - The **"dark mode"** document clustered close to the simulated query vector `[-1.0, 0.0, -0.2]`, showing that the system correctly picks up on the meaning of UI theming.
   - The **"React functional components"** document was close to the vector `[0.75, -0.75, 0.0]`, indicating strong similarity to questions about code structure.

2. **Unrelated Content is Far Away**:
   - The **project deadline** document (non-technical) had a vector far removed from the rest. This makes sense, because it’s not semantically similar to anything technical.

3. **Design and Interaction Embeddings Are Grouped**:
   - The documents about **colors**, **padding**, and **design tokens** were somewhat near each other, likely because they share a visual/UI theme in the embedding space.

###  Why This Matters:

Seeing these embeddings visually helped me *actually understand* that vectors aren't just random numbers—they represent meaning in a structured space. When I move a query vector around, I can see which documents it “gravitates” toward. That’s the core magic behind how RAG systems retrieve relevant info without exact word matches.

###  Summary

This visualization showed me how important embeddings are in modern AI. It’s not just about having a big model — it’s also about giving that model access to the right information, and embeddings help make that possible.

In the next step, I'll simulate retrieval using JavaScript to see if these patterns hold up in code!
